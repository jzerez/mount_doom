The purpose of this challenge was to explore optimization in the context of robotics. The challenge was to drive a NEATO robot as to find the local maximum of a surface using a gradient ascent algorithm. For reference, here is a  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zWqHOggKSs) of the robot completing the challenge.

This project was completed by [Julian Stone](https://github.com/julianstone5) and [Jonathan Yee](https://github.com/jzerez) for Module 3 of Quantitative Engineering Analysis at the Olin College of Engineering.
